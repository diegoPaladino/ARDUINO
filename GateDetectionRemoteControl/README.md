# GateDetectionRemoteControl

## Introduction
This project is designed to detect the opening of a gate at night and remotely send a signal (via local Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) to a relay module that will activate a 220V load.

## List of Necessary Materials
- Arduino (ESP8266 or similar)
- Gate sensor
- Relay module
- RTC module (e.g., DS3231)
- Wi-Fi network
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to enhance security by automatically controlling a load (such as lights or alarms) when a gate is opened during the night. This can help in deterring intruders and providing automated control over connected devices.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Enhances security by automating responses to gate openings.
- Uses readily available components.
- Flexible and expandable for additional features.

### Cons
- Requires a stable Wi-Fi connection.
- Initial setup can be complex for beginners.

## General Guidelines
### Setup Instructions
1. Connect the gate sensor to the specified pin on the Arduino.
2. Connect the relay module to the specified pin on the Arduino.
3. Connect the RTC module to the Arduino via I2C.
4. Upload the provided code to the Arduino.
5. Ensure the Arduino is connected to a Wi-Fi network.

### Usage
1. Power the system.
2. The system will monitor the gate sensor and activate the relay when the gate is opened at night.

### Troubleshooting
- Ensure the Wi-Fi credentials are correct.
- Check all connections and ensure the sensors and modules are properly connected.
- Monitor the serial output for debugging information.
