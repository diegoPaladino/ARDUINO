# LimitSwitchCounterArduino

## Introduction
The LimitSwitchCounterArduino is a C++ program designed for Arduino to count the number of times a limit switch is activated. This is particularly useful for automation and industrial applications where monitoring the number of operations or cycles is crucial.

## List of Necessary Materials
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Limit switch
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## Project Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to provide a simple and effective way to monitor and count the activations of a limit switch using an Arduino. This can be used in scenarios where monitoring the number of operations or cycles is crucial.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros
- Simple to set up and use
- Provides real-time counting of limit switch activations
- Cost-effective solution for monitoring limit switches

### Cons
- Requires basic knowledge of Arduino programming and setup
- Limited to applications where an Arduino is suitable

## General Guidelines

### Installation
1. Connect the limit switch to the Arduino board.
2. Ensure the pin number in the code matches your setup.
3. Upload the code to your Arduino using the Arduino IDE.

### Usage
1. Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to see the count of limit switch activations.
2. The program will display the number of times the limit switch is activated.

### Troubleshooting
- Ensure the limit switch is properly connected.
- Check the pin number in the code matches your setup.
- Make sure the Arduino board is functioning correctly.
