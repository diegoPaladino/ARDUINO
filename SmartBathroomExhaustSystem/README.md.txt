# SmartBathroomExhaustSystem

## Introduction
An Arduino-based system designed to automatically detect bad odors and excessive humidity in bathrooms and activate an exhaust fan.

## List of Necessary Materials
- Arduino Uno
- DHT11 Humidity and Temperature Sensor
- MQ-135 Gas Sensor
- Relay Module (for controlling the exhaust fan)
- Exhaust Fan
- Jumper Wires

## Purpose of the Project
To create a smart bathroom environment where the exhaust fan is automatically activated when unpleasant odors or high humidity levels are detected, ensuring a comfortable and odor-free bathroom experience.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Automated control of bathroom environment
- Easy to install and configure
- Enhances bathroom comfort and hygiene
### Cons
- Requires regular maintenance and calibration
- Dependent on the sensitivity and accuracy of the sensors

## General Guidelines
1. Connect the DHT11 and MQ-135 sensors to the Arduino.
2. Connect the relay module to control the exhaust fan.
3. Upload the code to the Arduino.
4. Adjust the thresholds in the code as needed for your specific bathroom environment.
5. The system will automatically activate the fan when high humidity or gas levels are detected.
