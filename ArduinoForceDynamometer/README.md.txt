# ArduinoForceDynamometer

## Introduction
This project involves creating a dynamometer using Arduino, capable of measuring force both in tension and compression modes.

## List of Necessary Materials
- Arduino Uno (or similar)
- HX711 Load Cell Amplifier
- Load cell
- Jumper wires

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to develop a low-cost, accurate dynamometer using simple components. It can measure force applied in both directions, useful in various mechanical and educational applications.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Affordable and accessible components
- Easy to assemble and program
- Versatile for various force measurement applications
### Cons
- Limited by the maximum force the load cell can handle
- Requires calibration for accurate measurements

## General Guidelines
1. Connect the HX711 to the Arduino as per the code.
2. Connect the load cell to the HX711.
3. Upload the code to the Arduino.
4. Calibrate the scale (adjust the calibration factor in the code as needed).
5. Start measuring forces by applying them to the load cell.
